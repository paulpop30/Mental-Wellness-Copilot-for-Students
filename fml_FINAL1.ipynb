      "\n",
      "1. Deep Breathing – Try the 4-7-8 technique:\n",
      " • Inhale quietly through your nose for a count of 4.\n",
      " • Hold your breath for a count of 7.\n",
      " • Exhale completely through your mouth for a count of 8.\n",
      "Repeat this cycle a few times to help slow your heart rate and calm your mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Progressive Muscle Relaxation – Tense and relax:\n",
      " • Start at your toes, tense the muscles tightly for about 5 seconds, then slowly release.\n",
      " • Work your way up through each muscle group (legs, abdomen, arms, face).\n",
      "This can help reduce physical tension that often accompanies anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Visualization – Picture a calming scene or success:\n",
      " • Close your eyes and imagine yourself in a peaceful place—like a quiet beach or a serene forest.\n",
      " • Alternatively, visualize yourself confidently taking the exam, which may boost your self-assurance.\n",
      "Even a few minutes of focused imagery can shift your mindset.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. Mindfulness Meditation – Focus on the present:\n",
      " • Find a comfortable seat and focus on your breath or a specific object.\n",
      " • If thoughts about the exam arise, acknowledge them without judgment and gently bring your attention back to the moment.\n",
      "This practice can help reduce rumination and anxiety.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Quick Physical Movement – Energize and reset:\n",
      " • Take a short walk around your room or do some light stretching.\n",
      " • A brief burst of physical activity can release built-up tension and refresh your mind.\n",
      "\n",
